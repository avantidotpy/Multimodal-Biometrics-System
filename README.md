# Biometrics Project - Multimodal Authentication Analysis

This repository contains the code for the "Analysis of Multimodal Biometric Authentication using different Deep Learning algorithms for Finger Vein and Iris recognition".

## Project Overview

The project focuses on providing an extensive analysis of deep learning models applied to two biometric modalities - Finger vein recognition and Iris recognition. We aim to identify the best-performing deep learning CNN models for each modality and combine them into a multimodal system for enhanced accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the SDUMLA-HMT database. It comprises finger vein images and iris images from the same individuals, providing a valuable resource for our analysis.

## Running the Code

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Preprocess the iris dataset using the provided Jupyter notebook.
3. Run the code for finger-vein recognition models.
4. Run the code for iris recognition models.
5. Use the saved pickle model files to execute the fusion model.

**Note:**
- This code is training-intensive and requires a minimum of 4 days to execute all the listed codes.
